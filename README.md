- Emphasize Team Collaboration: Foster teamwork, project management, and decision-making skills in a multi-app system.
- Enhance Professional Readiness: Provide hands-on experience with SOA, external APIs, and deployment, preparing developers for industry challenges.
- Prioritize User Empathy: Create an inclusive, user-centered design by developing detailed user stories and conducting equity analyses.

## Getting Started
Clone down the resposity to your location machine, cd into the direcotry and run:

- rails s or rails server

To see the app fully functioning you will also need to clone down the front end and run that as well.
